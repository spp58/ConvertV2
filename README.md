Issues solved
All the css is in a single separate file saving css duplication and making the code easier to work with.
The output should be to 2 decimal places but keeps reverting to multiple decimal places every 7 or 8 outputs. This is still an problem

Another conversion add miles to kilometers and vice versa.

Issues.
Every 7 or eight calculations still produces multiple decimals places answer rather than 2.
Styling could be better.
javascripts should be one file instead of internal html
